Comparing NFL Season wins to future wins with Predictives

***R File contains cool statistics with some neat plots. Jupyter Notebook contains extra summary***

A common metric to use when predicting sporting season outcomes is analysis of the Pythaogrean Expectation. 

This project focused on gathering data from pro-football-reference.com and compiling it into previous season wins vs current season wins.

1. Last Season vs This Season
  Basic plot showing every teams W/L ratio for one season versus their previous season with a line of best fit 
  
2. Predicted Regression Analysis
  A plot showing the residuals of a regression prediction when using previous season's points for as the predictive variable
  
3. Influential Points
  Showing possible outliers or at the very least, more influential teams that may warrant further examination.
  
4. Pythagorean Ratio
  Plot comparing the current season's Pythagorean Ratio to the points scored in the last season. A higher ratio at both ends is generally a better team.
  Interestingly, there isn't a noticable correlation with this plot.
